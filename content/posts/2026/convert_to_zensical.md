My main GitHub Page 
[maroph/maroph.github.io](https://github.com/maroph/maroph.github.io)
is created with the [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) based 
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
framework.

Today I have pushed my first [Zensical](https://zensical.org/) based
version. In a first step I used the original _mkdocs.yml_ config file without
any problems. Now I have converted all the config data to the TOML format, used
in the Zensical config file _zensical.toml_.

The only missing thing in creating my site is the functionality of the 
Material privacy plugin.
